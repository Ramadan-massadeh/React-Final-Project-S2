MyStore â€“ React E-Commerce Project

This is a simple online store built with React. It lets users see products, add them to a shopping cart, and go to checkout. The project uses Context API to manage the cart and React Router for navigation between pages.

## What it can do:

- Show all products from a fake API or local JSON server.
- Add, remove, increase, and decrease items in the cart.
- Keep the cart saved even after refreshing the page.
- Show toast messages (like "added to cart").
- Has pages like Checkout and Contact Us.
- Looks good on all screen sizes (responsive).
- Simple and clean navbar and footer.

## Tools used:

- React
- React Router
- Context API
- Toastify (for messages)
- JSON Server
- CSS (not modules)

## Testing:

I wrote 3 tests using Vitest and React Testing Library:

1. Test that "Add to Cart" button appears.
2. Test that links in the navbar appear (Home, Cart, Contact).
3. Test that an empty cart shows the message like "Your cart is empty".
